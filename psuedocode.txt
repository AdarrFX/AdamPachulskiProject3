Interactive punch card reader
Pseudocode

Message limit: 15 characters

START (Process message)
-Receive input from user from a typed message in input box (string)

-Convert string message to UTF-8 decimal number values and store each value in an array

-Convert decimal array to two-dimensional binary array:

--- First binary array dimension representing the single character

--- Second binary array dimension for each single character filled with single string values of '0' or '1'.

-Using Jquery, render HTML div classes of 'row', and in 'row', 'holes', with a seperate class of 'punched' (1) or 'unpunched'(0) to the DOM on the punch card.

READ (Read message)
-Clear the punch card and fill it with div hole elements, all unpunched

-Allow the user to click on a hole to punch it out. For purposes of the game, the hole can be unpunched after it is punched (togglable state)

-READ button is pressed, storing the values in a two dimensional binary array, similar to the Process function above.
--- Function will loop through the punch-holes and check to see if it has a class of 'punched' applied. If so, add a "1" to the binary array, and if not punched, add a "0".

-Read function will read through each character represented by the binary array and parse the value to a decimal number.

-Decimal number will be converted to a UTF-8 character from the decimal value and stored in a string array.

-Converted Message will be displayed in the input text area, or a more appropriate display area if there is time to code it.

ERROR HANDLING:
-8 bit binary can only store up to value 256.

- Code will ensure that user can only enter UTF-8 characters up to value 256, anything over will result in an error and a text reminder.

STRETCH GOALS:
--- Implementing code to animate the punch card reader 'punching out' and 'reading' the card. Will require use of time/animation functions.
--- Create a punch card of more dynamic size rather than being limited to only 15 characters.
